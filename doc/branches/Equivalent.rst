Equivalencies
=============
The following equivalencies of the axiom of choice are known to hold:

Set theory
----------
    * **Tarski's theorem about choice**: For every infinite set A, there is a bijective map between the sets A and A×A.
    * **Trichotomy**: If two sets are given, then either they have the same cardinality, or one has a smaller cardinality than the other.
    * Given two non-empty sets, one has a surjection to the other.
    * Every surjective function has a right inverse.
    * The Cartesian product of any family of nonempty sets is nonempty. In other words, every family of nonempty sets has a choice function (i.e. a function which maps each of the nonempty sets to one of its elements).
    * **König's theorem**: Colloquially, the sum of a sequence of cardinals is strictly less than the product of a sequence of larger cardinals. (The reason for the term "colloquially" is that the sum or product of a "sequence" of cardinals cannot itself be defined without some aspect of the axiom of choice.)
    * **Well-ordering theorem**: Every set can be well-ordered. Consequently, every cardinal has an initial ordinal.
    * Every element of a partially ordered set S is the minimal element of a well-ordered subset having no strict upper bound in S.
    * **Zorn's lemma**: Every non-empty partially ordered set in which every chain (i.e., totally ordered subset) has an upper bound contains at least one maximal element.
    * **Hausdorff maximal principle**: Every partially ordered set has a maximal chain. Equivalently, in any partially ordered set, every chain can be extended to a maximal chain.
    * **Tukey's lemma**: Every non-empty collection of finite character has a maximal element with respect to inclusion.
    * **Antichain principle**: Every partially ordered set has a maximal antichain. Equivalently, in any partially ordered set, every antichain can be extended to a maximal antichain.

Abstract algebra
----------------
    * Every vector space has a basis (i.e., a linearly independent spanning subset). In other words, vector spaces are equivalent to free modules.
    * **Krull's theorem**: Every unital ring (other than the trivial ring) contains a maximal ideal. Equivalently, in any nontrivial unital ring, every ideal can be extended to a maximal ideal.
    * For every non-empty set S there is a binary operation defined on S that gives it a group structure. (A cancellative binary operation is enough, see group structure and the axiom of choice.)
    * Every free abelian group is projective.
    * **Baer's criterion**: Every divisible abelian group is injective.
    * Every set is a projective object in the category Set of sets.

Functional analysis
-------------------
    * The closed unit ball of the dual of a normed vector space over the reals has an extreme point.

Point-set topology
------------------
    * The Cartesian product of any family of connected topological spaces is connected.
    * **Tychonoff's theorem**: The Cartesian product of any family of compact topological spaces is compact.
    * In the product topology, the closure of a product of subsets is equal to the product of the closures.

Mathematical logic
------------------
    * If S is a set of sentences of first-order logic and B is a consistent subset of S, then B is included in a set that is maximal among consistent subsets of S. The special case where S is the set of all first-order sentences in a given signature is weaker, equivalent to the Boolean prime ideal theorem; see the section "Weaker forms" below.

Algebraic topology
------------------
    * Every connected graph has a spanning tree. Equivalently, every nonempty graph has a spanning forest.

.. note::
    The well-ordering actually used the axiom of choice as the basis for its proof, and was then shown to be equivalent to it after.
